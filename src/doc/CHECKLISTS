* Beware of Argument-Dependent Lookup, put specializations into std in the same header as the class definition.

* boost::format bug with uint8_t arguments. Use static_cast<int> on uint8_t arguments.

* All const-methods should be read-only-thread-safe.
  Remember when using "mutable" members in objects, or when mutating any other (global or not) state from
  const method. Use std::atomic<>, xf::Synchronized<> to help.
